The problem is straightforward: analyze how the range of a projectile depends on its angle of projection. Yet, beneath this simplicity lies a complex and versatile framework. The equations governing projectile motion involve both linear and quadratic relationships, making them accessible yet deeply insightful. What makes this topic particularly compelling is the number of free parameters involved in these equations, such as initial velocity, gravitational acceleration, and launch height. These parameters give rise to a diverse set of solutions that can describe a wide array of real-world phenomena, from the arc of a soccer ball to the trajectory of a rocket. 1. Theoretical Foundation Governing Equations Projectile motion follows Newton\u2019s second law, and we assume motion under constant acceleration due to gravity, ignoring air resistance. The horizontal motion is governed by: $$ x = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) t $$ The vertical motion follows: $$ y = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 $$ Solving for the time of flight when the projectile returns to the ground ( \\( \\(y=0\\) \\) ): \\[ t_f = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} \\] The range, which is the horizontal distance traveled, is given by: \\[ R = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) t_f = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\] Family of Solutions The range is maximized when \\( \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\) \\) , as \\( \\(\\sin(2\\theta)\\) \\) reaches its peak at this angle. Different values of \\( \\(v_0\\) \\) and \\( \\(g\\) \\) shift the entire curve up or down, affecting the overall range. 2. Analysis of the Range The function $$ R(\\theta) = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} $$ follows a sinusoidal form, reaching its peak at 45 degrees. Increasing \\( \\(v_0\\) \\) increases the range quadratically. A higher gravitational acceleration \\( \\(g\\) \\) decreases the range.

Conclusion"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_2/","text":"Investigating the Dynamics of a Forced Damped Pendulum Motivation The forced damped pendulum is a captivating example of a physical system with intricate behavior resulting from the interplay of damping, restoring forces, and external driving forces. By introducing both damping and external periodic forcing, the system demonstrates a transition from simple harmonic motion to a rich spectrum of dynamics, including resonance, chaos, and quasiperiodic behavior. These phenomena serve as a foundation for understanding complex real-world systems, such as driven oscillators, climate systems, and mechanical structures under periodic stress. Adding forcing introduces new parameters, such as the amplitude and frequency of the external force, which significantly affect the pendulum's behavior. By systematically varying these parameters, a diverse class of solutions can be observed, including synchronized oscillations, chaotic motion, and resonance phenomena. These behaviors not only highlight fundamental physics principles but also provide insights into engineering applications such as energy harvesting, vibration isolation, and mechanical resonance. 1. Theoretical Foundation Governing Equation The motion of a forced damped pendulum is governed by the nonlinear differential equation: \\[ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + b \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\omega_0^2 \\sin(\\theta) = A \\cos(\\omega t) \\] where: - \\(\\theta\\) is the angular displacement, - \\(b\\) is the damping coefficient, - \\(\\omega_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{L}}\\) is the natural frequency of the pendulum, - \\(A\\) is the amplitude of the external driving force, - \\(\\omega\\) is the driving frequency. For small angles, we approximate \\(\\sin\\theta \\approx \\theta\\) , leading to the linearized equation: \\[ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + b \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\omega_0^2 \\theta = A \\cos(\\omega t) \\] Resonance Condition Resonance occurs when the driving frequency \\(\\omega\\) is close to the system's natural frequency \\(\\omega_0\\) . This leads to an increase in amplitude, potentially causing instability or breakdown of the approximation. 2. Analysis of Dynamics The damping coefficient \\(b\\) controls energy dissipation. The driving amplitude \\(A\\) determines how strongly the external force influences the motion. The driving frequency \\(\\omega\\) dictates whether resonance or chaotic motion occurs. The transition to chaotic motion can be studied by analyzing phase space diagrams and Poincar\u00e9 sections. 3.

Discussion on Model Limitations The model assumes a simple sinusoidal driving force; real-world forces may be more complex. Air resistance introduces additional nonlinear damping effects. Large-angle oscillations require the full nonlinear equation without the small-angle approximation. 6. Advanced Visualizations To better analyze the system, we can visualize: Phase Portraits: Plotting \\(\\theta\\) vs. \\(d\\theta/dt\\) to observe periodic and chaotic behavior. Poincar\u00e9 Sections: Sampling the phase space at regular time intervals. Bifurcation Diagrams: Varying \\(A\\) or \\(\\omega\\) to observe transitions between periodic and chaotic motion. 7. Conclusion The forced damped pendulum showcases rich dynamical behavior, from simple oscillations to chaotic motion. By adjusting parameters, we can explore resonance, synchronization, and chaotic regimes. This system has far-reaching applications in engineering, physics, and even biological systems such as gait dynamics and neural oscillations.

Conclusion"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_1/","text":"Problem 1 Orbital Period and Orbital Radius: Kepler's Third Law 1. Deriving Kepler's Third Law for Circular Orbits To derive the relationship between orbital period (T) and orbital radius (r) for circular orbits, I'll use Newton's law of universal gravitation and the principles of circular motion. For a body of mass m orbiting a central body of mass M in a circular orbit: The gravitational force acting on the orbiting body is: F_g = (GMm)/(r\u00b2) For circular motion, this force provides the centripetal acceleration: F_c = m\u03c9\u00b2r = m(4\u03c0\u00b2r)/(T\u00b2) Where \u03c9 is the angular velocity, related to the period by \u03c9 = 2\u03c0/T. At equilibrium, these forces are equal: (GMm)/(r\u00b2) = (4\u03c0\u00b2mr)/(T\u00b2) Simplifying: (GM)/(r\u00b2) = (4\u03c0\u00b2r)/(T\u00b2) Rearranging to isolate the relationship between T and r: T\u00b2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2r\u00b3)/(GM) Therefore: T\u00b2 \u221d r\u00b3 More specifically: T\u00b2/r\u00b3 = 4\u03c0\u00b2/(GM) This is Kepler's Third Law: the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the orbital radius. 2. Implications for Astronomy Kepler's Third Law has profound implications for astronomy: Mass Determination : By measuring the orbital period and radius of a satellite, we can determine the mass of the central body: M = (4\u03c0\u00b2r\u00b3)/(GT\u00b2) This allows astronomers to calculate the masses of planets, stars, and even galaxies by observing the motion of their satellites. Distance Measurement : If we know the period of an orbiting body and the mass of the central body, we can determine its orbital distance. Exoplanet Detection : When studying stars with planets, slight variations in the star's motion can reveal the presence of planets and help determine their masses and orbits. Binary Star Systems : For binary stars, this relationship helps determine the combined mass of the system. Scale of the Solar System : Once we know the relationship for one planet, we can determine the relative distances of other planets without direct measurement. 3. Real-World Examples Earth-Moon System Moon's orbital radius: approximately 384,400 km Moon's orbital period: 27.3 days (2,360,160 seconds) Using Kepler's Third Law: T\u00b2/r\u00b3 = 4\u03c0\u00b2/(GM_Earth) We can verify that this relationship holds and use it to calculate Earth's mass.

Practical Applications Satellite Deployment : Engineers use this relationship to determine the orbital altitude needed for a desired orbital period (e.g., geosynchronous satellites). Space Mission Planning : For missions to other planets, understanding orbital mechanics based on Kepler's laws is essential for trajectory planning. Dark Matter Detection : Deviations from expected orbital behavior based on Kepler's Third Law helped identify the presence of dark matter in galaxies. Exoplanet Characterization : By measuring orbital periods and star masses, astronomers can determine exoplanet orbital distances and potential habitability. Conclusion Kepler's Third Law represents a fundamental relationship in celestial mechanics that connects the period of an orbit to its size. This simple power law (T\u00b2 \u221d r\u00b3) has enormous explanatory and predictive power in astronomy, from calculating the masses of celestial bodies to understanding the structure of planetary systems. The computational model demonstrates that this relationship holds remarkably well for the planets in our solar system.

For a body of mass m orbiting a central body of mass M in a circular orbit: The gravitational force acting on the orbiting body is: F_g = (GMm)/(r\u00b2) For circular motion, this force provides the centripetal acceleration: F_c = m\u03c9\u00b2r = m(4\u03c0\u00b2r)/(T\u00b2) Where \u03c9 is the angular velocity, related to the period by \u03c9 = 2\u03c0/T.

Single point source (for reference) 2. Two sources (line segment) 3. Three sources (equilateral triangle) 4. Four sources (square) 5. Five sources (regular pentagon) For each configuration, we: - Positioned the sources at equal distances from the origin - Assumed all sources emit waves with identical amplitude, wavelength, and frequency - Applied the superposition principle to calculate the displacement at each point - Identified regions of constructive and destructive interference - Visualized the resulting patterns in 2D and 3D Simulation Parameters In our simulation, we used the following parameters: - Wave amplitude (A): 1 unit - Wavelength (\u03bb): 1 unit - Frequency (f): 1 Hz - Distance from center to polygon vertices: 2 units - Simulation area: 10\u00d710 square units Results by Polygon Type Single Source (Point) A single source produces concentric circular waves radiating outward. With just one source, there's no interference pattern\u2014just the familiar ripple pattern that decreases in amplitude with distance from the source (due to the spreading of the wave energy). Two Sources (Line) With two sources, we observe: - A series of hyperbolic nodal lines (where destructive interference occurs) - Alternating bands of constructive and destructive interference perpendicular to the line connecting the sources - The spacing between adjacent maxima is \u03bb/2 along directions perpendicular to the source axis - The pattern exhibits mirror symmetry along both the line connecting the sources and the perpendicular bisector This pattern is analogous to Young's double-slit experiment in optics. Points where waves arrive with a path difference of n\u03bb (where n is an integer) experience constructive interference, while points with a path difference of (n+\u00bd)\u03bb experience destructive interference. Three Sources (Equilateral Triangle) With three sources arranged in an equilateral triangle, we observe: - A complex hexagonal-like pattern with six-fold symmetry - Distinctive star-shaped regions of constructive interference - Multiple nodal lines (regions of destructive interference) creating intricate patterns - High-amplitude regions at the center where waves from all three sources can constructively interfere - The pattern repeats radially with decreasing intensity as distance from the center increases The triangular arrangement creates a beautiful pattern that reflects the geometric symmetry of the source configuration. The six-fold symmetry (rather than three-fold) occurs because each pair of sources creates its own interference pattern, and these patterns overlap. Four Sources (Square) With four sources arranged in a square, we observe: - A pattern with four-fold rotational symmetry - A grid-like interference pattern with consistent nodal spacing - Strong constructive interference at the center and along certain radial directions - More complex interaction regions farther from the sources - Clear periodic structure in both x and y directions The square arrangement produces more ordered patterns than the triangle, with perpendicular nodal lines that form a lattice-like structure. This greater regularity results from the higher symmetry of the square compared to the triangle. Five Sources (Pentagon) With five sources arranged in a regular pentagon, we observe: - A star-like pattern with five-fold symmetry - More densely packed nodal lines - Complex regions of constructive interference that form pentagonal patterns - Highly symmetric behavior that mirrors the geometry of the source arrangement - A blend of order and complexity that creates visually striking patterns The five-source arrangement demonstrates how increasing the number of coherent sources creates more intricate and detailed interference patterns. Key Observations and Physical Insights 1. Symmetry Relationship The symmetry of the interference pattern directly reflects the symmetry of the source arrangement. An n-sided regular polygon produces patterns with n-fold rotational symmetry. This is a manifestation of the principle that the symmetry of a physical system is preserved in its solutions. 2. Constructive and Destructive Interference Constructive Interference : Occurs when waves arrive in phase, resulting in amplification. The maximum possible amplitude is n\u00b7A, where n is the number of sources and A is the amplitude of each wave. Destructive Interference : Occurs when waves arrive out of phase, resulting in cancellation. Complete destructive interference requires waves to arrive with exactly opposite phases. 3. Distance Effects The interference pattern changes with distance from the source array: - Near Field : Close to the sources, the pattern is dominated by the proximity to individual sources - Intermediate Field : Complex interference patterns are most evident - Far Field : The pattern simplifies and eventually resembles that of a single source with modified amplitude This transition from near to far field is important in many applications, such as antenna arrays and acoustic systems. 4. Wavelength Relationship The spacing between nodal lines is directly related to the wavelength: - Shorter wavelengths produce more densely packed interference patterns - Changing the wavelength scales the pattern spatially without changing its fundamental structure - For a fixed source geometry, the pattern repeats at distances of \u03bb from each source 5. Time Evolution Our animation shows how the interference pattern evolves over time: - The pattern appears to radiate outward from the sources - The overall structure of constructive and destructive regions remains fixed in space - Individual points oscillate between positive and negative displacement - The animation helps visualize the wave nature of the phenomenon Applications and Practical Significance Understanding water wave interference patterns has applications in various fields: Wave Engineering : Designing breakwaters and coastal structures to control wave impact Acoustics : Designing speaker arrays for directional sound propagation Electromagnetic Waves : Antenna array design for directional transmission and reception Optical Systems : Holography, interferometry, and diffraction gratings Quantum Mechanics : Understanding electron and matter wave interference Seismology : Analyzing seismic wave patterns for geological study Conclusions This analysis demonstrates the rich and complex behavior that emerges when multiple coherent wave sources interact. The resulting interference patterns reveal fundamental properties of waves and the principle of superposition. Our observations confirm that: 1. The principle of superposition accurately predicts the complex patterns formed by overlapping waves 2. Geometric arrangement of sources directly influences the symmetry and structure of interference patterns 3. As the number of sources increases, the interference patterns become more complex while maintaining the underlying symmetry of the source arrangement The visualization tools we've developed allow for intuitive understanding of these complex wave phenomena, making abstract concepts tangible and accessible. The ability to manipulate parameters such as wavelength, amplitude, and source geometry provides a powerful framework for exploring wave behavior in various contexts. These findings highlight the universal nature of wave interference, demonstrating principles that apply across different physical domains\u2014from water waves to light, sound, and quantum mechanical waves.","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/3%20Waves/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/3%20Waves/Problem_1/#water-wave-interference-patterns-analysis","text":"","title":"Water Wave Interference Patterns Analysis"},{"location":"1%20Physics/3%20Waves/Problem_1/#introduction","text":"This document presents a comprehensive analysis of interference patterns formed by water waves emanating from point sources positioned at the vertices of regular polygons.

Exploration of Applications Systems where the Lorentz force plays a key role The Lorentz force, expressed as F = qE + qv \u00d7 B , governs the motion of charged particles in electric and magnetic fields and is fundamental in numerous scientific and technological applications: Particle Accelerators : Linear accelerators and cyclotrons use precisely controlled electromagnetic fields to accelerate charged particles to high energies for research and medical applications. Mass Spectrometers : These devices separate ions based on their mass-to-charge ratio using magnetic fields that curve particle trajectories differently depending on their properties. Plasma Confinement : Tokamaks and stellarators use magnetic fields to confine hot plasma for fusion research, preventing the charged particles from contacting and cooling against reactor walls. Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) Generators : These convert thermal and kinetic energy directly into electricity using the movement of conductive plasma through a magnetic field. Hall Thrusters : Used in spacecraft propulsion, these accelerate ions using electric fields while magnetic fields trap electrons that help maintain the electric field. Electron Microscopes : Both transmission and scanning electron microscopes use magnetic fields to focus beams of electrons. Relevance of electric (E) and magnetic (B) fields Electric and magnetic fields control charged particle motion in complementary ways: Electric Fields (E) : Cause acceleration parallel to field lines Force magnitude depends on charge (q) but not velocity Energy-changing (can increase or decrease particle energy) Used primarily to accelerate particles along straight paths Critical for increasing particle energy in accelerators Magnetic Fields (B) : Cause acceleration perpendicular to both the field and particle velocity Force magnitude depends on both charge (q) and velocity (v) Energy-conserving (changes direction but not speed in uniform fields) Creates circular, helical, or drift motions Used for steering, focusing, and confining charged particles 2.

While traditional methods involve iteratively applying series and parallel resistor rules, these approaches can become cumbersome for complex circuits with many components. Graph theory offers a powerful alternative, providing a structured and algorithmic way to analyze circuits. By representing a circuit as a graph\u2014where nodes correspond to junctions and edges represent resistors with weights equal to their resistance values\u2014we can systematically simplify even the most intricate networks. This method not only streamlines calculations but also opens the door to automated analysis, making it particularly useful in modern applications like circuit simulation software, optimization problems, and network design. Studying equivalent resistance through graph theory is valuable not only for its practical applications but also for the deeper insights it provides into the interplay between electrical and mathematical concepts. This approach highlights the versatility of graph theory, demonstrating its relevance across physics, engineering, and computer science.

According to the CLT, regardless of the original population distribution, the sampling distribution of the sample mean will approach a normal distribution as the sample size increases. This report presents a comprehensive exploration of the CLT through computational simulations using Python. Theoretical Background The Central Limit Theorem states that if we take sufficiently large random samples from any population with a finite mean \u03bc and variance \u03c3\u00b2, then the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normally distributed with mean \u03bc and standard deviation \u03c3/\u221an, where n is the sample size.

Basic Sampling Distribution Analysis For each distribution, we observed the following patterns: Uniform Distribution [0, 10] Theoretical Mean: 5.0 Theoretical Standard Deviation: 2.89 Observations: - Even with small sample sizes (n=5), the sampling distribution already shows a bell-shaped curve - At n=30, the sampling distribution is nearly indistinguishable from a normal distribution - The standard error decreases proportionally to \u221an as expected Exponential Distribution (\u03bb=0.5) Theoretical Mean: 2.0 Theoretical Standard Deviation: 2.0 Observations: - The original distribution is highly right-skewed - With n=5, the sampling distribution still shows noticeable skewness - Only at n=30 does the sampling distribution become visibly normal - The convergence to normality is slower than for the uniform distribution Binomial Distribution (n=20, p=0.3) Theoretical Mean: 6.0 Theoretical Standard Deviation: 2.05 Observations: - Despite being a discrete distribution, the sampling distribution quickly approaches normality - By n=10, the sampling distribution closely resembles a normal distribution - The discrete nature of the original distribution has minimal impact on the convergence rate Chi-Square Distribution (df=3) Theoretical Mean: 3.0 Theoretical Standard Deviation: 2.45 Observations: - Highly right-skewed original distribution - Similar to the exponential distribution, convergence to normality is relatively slow - Even at n=50, the sampling distribution maintains a slight right skew 2. Q-Q Plot Analysis The Q-Q plots confirm our visual observations: For the uniform distribution, even at n=5, points follow the reference line closely For the exponential and chi-square distributions, smaller sample sizes (n=5, 10) show deviations in the tails As sample size increases, the Q-Q plots show progressively better alignment with the reference line for all distributions 3. Convergence Rate Analysis The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test statistic provides a quantitative measure of the distance between the sampling distribution and a normal distribution. Our analysis shows: Symmetric distributions (uniform, binomial) converge more quickly to normality Skewed distributions (exponential, chi-square) require larger sample sizes For all distributions, the KS statistic decreases approximately proportionally to 1/\u221an The mean absolute error plots demonstrate that estimation accuracy improves with the square root of the sample size, consistent with theoretical expectations. 4. Standard Error Verification Our simulations confirm that the standard error of the sample mean follows the formula \u03c3/\u221an: For all distributions, the ratio of observed to expected standard error approaches 1.0 as sample size increases Minor deviations at very small sample sizes (n<5) likely stem from the central limit theorem not yet fully applying Practical Applications The Central Limit Theorem has significant implications across various fields: 1. Quality Control in Manufacturing In manufacturing environments, products naturally exhibit variability. The CLT allows quality engineers to: - Take small samples (typically n=5 to 30) to monitor process outputs - Calculate control limits based on normal distribution properties - Make statistical inferences despite not knowing the underlying distribution of individual measurements - Detect process shifts efficiently using statistical process control charts 2. Financial Risk Management Financial markets often involve non-normal distributions of returns. The CLT helps risk managers: - Aggregate individual asset returns into portfolio returns that are more normally distributed - Apply Value-at-Risk (VaR) models that rely on normal distribution assumptions - Assess the reliability of mean return estimates based on sample size - Develop more robust risk models by understanding the limitations of normality assumptions 3. Survey Sampling and Public Opinion Research When conducting surveys, researchers benefit from the CLT by: - Making inferences about population parameters from sample statistics - Calculating confidence intervals for estimates like approval ratings or voter preferences - Determining appropriate sample sizes to achieve desired levels of precision - Combining multiple survey results with sound statistical methodology 4. Healthcare and Clinical Trials In medical research, the CLT supports: - Analysis of treatment effects across patient populations - Determination of minimum sample sizes needed for statistical power - Interpretation of biomarker measurements and laboratory test results - Meta-analysis of multiple studies to reach more robust conclusions Conclusion Our simulation study confirms that the Central Limit Theorem holds across various population distributions. The sampling distribution of the sample mean consistently approaches a normal distribution as sample size increases, with the rate of convergence depending on the characteristics of the original distribution. Key findings include: Universal Applicability : The CLT applies regardless of the shape of the original population distribution, though convergence rates differ. Sample Size Impact : While the theorem technically applies as n approaches infinity, practical applications show that: For symmetric distributions, n\u226530 is typically sufficient for reliable normality For highly skewed distributions, larger sample sizes (n\u226550) may be necessary The standard error decreases predictably with the square root of the sample size Distribution Characteristics : The original distribution's shape affects convergence: Symmetric distributions converge more quickly Skewed distributions require larger sample sizes Discrete distributions converge similarly to continuous ones These findings have profound implications for statistical inference, allowing practitioners to make valid probabilistic statements about population parameters even when the population distribution is unknown or non-normal. This powerful property underlies countless statistical methods used across scientific disciplines and industries. The Central Limit Theorem thus serves as a bridge between the complex, often unknown distributions of real-world phenomena and the tractable, well-understood properties of the normal distribution, enabling robust statistical inference in the face of uncertainty.","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/6%20Statistics/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/6%20Statistics/Problem_1/#exploring-the-central-limit-theorem-through-simulations","text":"","title":"Exploring the Central Limit Theorem through Simulations"},{"location":"1%20Physics/6%20Statistics/Problem_1/#introduction","text":"The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics that describes the behavior of the sampling distribution of the mean for sufficiently large sample sizes.

The sampling distribution of the sample mean consistently approaches a normal distribution as sample size increases, with the rate of convergence depending on the characteristics of the original distribution. Key findings include: Universal Applicability : The CLT applies regardless of the shape of the original population distribution, though convergence rates differ. Sample Size Impact : While the theorem technically applies as n approaches infinity, practical applications show that: For symmetric distributions, n\u226530 is typically sufficient for reliable normality For highly skewed distributions, larger sample sizes (n\u226550) may be necessary The standard error decreases predictably with the square root of the sample size Distribution Characteristics : The original distribution's shape affects convergence: Symmetric distributions converge more quickly Skewed distributions require larger sample sizes Discrete distributions converge similarly to continuous ones These findings have profound implications for statistical inference, allowing practitioners to make valid probabilistic statements about population parameters even when the population distribution is unknown or non-normal. This powerful property underlies countless statistical methods used across scientific disciplines and industries. The Central Limit Theorem thus serves as a bridge between the complex, often unknown distributions of real-world phenomena and the tractable, well-understood properties of the normal distribution, enabling robust statistical inference in the face of uncertainty.","title":"Conclusion"},{"location":"1%20Physics/6%20Statistics/Problem_2/","text":"Problem 2","title":"Problem 2"},{"location":"1%20Physics/6%20Statistics/Problem_2/#problem-2","text":"","title":"Problem 2"},{"location":"1%20Physics/7%20Measurements/Problem_1/","text":"Problem 1","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/7%20Measurements/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"2%20Mathematics/1%20Linear_algebra/","text":"Linear Algebra","title":"Linear Algebra"},{"location":"2%20Mathematics/1%20Linear_algebra/#linear-algebra","text":"","title":"Linear Algebra"},{"location":"2%20Mathematics/2%20Analytic_geometry/","text":"Analytic geometry","title":"Analytic geometry"},{"location":"2%20Mathematics/2%20Analytic_geometry/#analytic-geometry","text":"","title":"Analytic geometry"},{"location":"2%20Mathematics/3%20Calculus/","text":"Calculus","title":"Calculus"},{"location":"2%20Mathematics/3%20Calculus/#calculus","text":"","title":"Calculus"},{"location":"3%20Discret_Mathematics/1%20Set%20Theory%20and%20.../_02%20Set_Theory/","text":"Set Theory","title":"Set Theory"},{"location":"3%20Discret_Mathematics/1%20Set%20Theory%20and%20.../_02%20Set_Theory/#set-theory","text":"","title":"Set Theory"},{"location":"3%20Discret_Mathematics/1%20Set%20Theory%20and%20.../_03%20Relations/","text":"Relations","title":"Relations"},{"location":"3%20Discret_Mathematics/1%20Set%20Theory%20and%20.../_03%20Relations/#relations","text":"","title":"Relations"},{"location":"3%20Discret_Mathematics/1%20Set%20Theory%20and%20.../_04%20Functions/","text":"Functions","title":"Functions"},{"location":"3%20Discret_Mathematics/1%20Set%20Theory%20and%20.../_04%20Functions/#functions","text":"","title":"Functions"},{"location":"3%20Discret_Mathematics/2%20Number%20Theory%20and%20.../_05%20Combinatorics/","text":"Combinatorics","title":"Combinatorics"},{"location":"3%20Discret_Mathematics/2%20Number%20Theory%20and%20.../_05%20Combinatorics/#combinatorics","text":"","title":"Combinatorics"},{"location":"3%20Discret_Mathematics/2%20Number%20Theory%20and%20.../_08%20Number_Theory/","text":"Number Theory","title":"Number Theory"},{"location":"3%20Discret_Mathematics/2%20Number%20Theory%20and%20.../_08%20Number_Theory/#number-theory","text":"","title":"Number Theory"},{"location":"3%20Discret_Mathematics/3%20Recurrence%20and%20.../_06%20Sequences_and_Series/","text":"Sequences and Series","title":"Sequences and Series"},{"location":"3%20Discret_Mathematics/3%20Recurrence%20and%20.../_06%20Sequences_and_Series/#sequences-and-series","text":"","title":"Sequences and Series"},{"location":"3%20Discret_Mathematics/3%20Recurrence%20and%20.../_07%20Induction/","text":"Induction","title":"Induction"},{"location":"3%20Discret_Mathematics/3%20Recurrence%20and%20.../_07%20Induction/#induction","text":"","title":"Induction"},{"location":"3%20Discret_Mathematics/3%20Recurrence%20and%20.../_09%20Recurrence/","text":"Recurrence","title":"Recurrence"},{"location":"3%20Discret_Mathematics/3%20Recurrence%20and%20.../_09%20Recurrence/#recurrence","text":"","title":"Recurrence"},{"location":"3%20Discret_Mathematics/4%20Graph%20Theory%20and%20.../_10%20Graph_Theory/","text":"Graph Theory","title":"Graph Theory"},{"location":"3%20Discret_Mathematics/4%20Graph%20Theory%20and%20.../_10%20Graph_Theory/#graph-theory","text":"","title":"Graph Theory"},{"location":"3%20Discret_Mathematics/5%20Logic/_01%20Logic/","text":"Logic","title":"Logic"},{"location":"3%20Discret_Mathematics/5%20Logic/_01%20Logic/#logic","text":"","title":"Logic"}]}
